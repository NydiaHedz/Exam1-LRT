# Exam1-LRT

This repository contains two exercises implemented using ROS (Robot Operating System) to control turtles in the turtlesim simulator.

## Exercise 1: Random Turtle Spawning
This program generates 5 additional turtles at random positions within the Turtlesim workspace. Each turtle is placed at random (x,y) coordinates with a random orientation. The program uses Turtlesim's Spawn service to create the new instances.
